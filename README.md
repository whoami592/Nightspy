Notes
The script uses ANSI color codes (\033[94m, etc.) for a themed console output, which works on most terminals (Linux/macOS, Windows with modern terminals like PowerShell or WSL).
Logs are saved to a timestamped file to maintain stealth and allow later analysis.
Error handling ensures the script skips inaccessible processes (e.g., system processes) and logs issues.
If you meant a different tool (e.g., a typo for py-spy, a profiling tool from, or something else), please provide more details, and Iâ€™ll create the correct artifact.
If you want enhancements (e.g., GUI, network monitoring, or specific "spy" features), let me know!
